          I was raised in a Jehovah Witness family and served as a regular
          pioneer and volunteer drafter in Portland, Oregon. At the height of my
          Theocratic career, I left it all behind to start a new life, free from
          my controlling family and religion and resulting in being totally
          shunned by everyone I knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the five years since then I've been busy building a new life. I've
          had many firsts as I've been learning what freedom is. I met the love
          of my life, started traveling and started a new career as a software
          engineer. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer and live in
          Missoula, Montana with my partner Joel and our beagle, Charlie.

          My blog post are mostly stories about my life as a Jehovah Witness and
          journey of self-discovery.
