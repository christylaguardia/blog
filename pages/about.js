          I was raised in a Jehovah Witness family and served as a regular
          pioneer and engineering volunteer on the Regional Building Committee
          in Portland, Oregon. Five years ago, at the height of my Theocratic
          career, I left it all behind to start a new life, free from my
          controlling family and religion.

          My blog post are mostly stories about my life as a Jehovah Witness and
          journey of self-discovery.
