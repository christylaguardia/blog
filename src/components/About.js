        I was raised in a Jehovah Witness family and served as a regular pioneer
        and engineering volunteer on the Regional Building Committee in
        Portland, Oregon. Five years ago, at the height of my Theocratic career,
        I left it all behind to start a new life, free from my controlling
        family and religion.
